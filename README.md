# Activity Detection 🚴🚶‍♂️🧎‍♀️

[@MaciejMomot](https://github.com/MaciejMomot) and I conducted an analysis of physical activities. Our task was to identify patterns in a dataset containing various physical activities.

Dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/luisomoreau/activity-detection.

The presentation of the results can be found [here](https://github.com/FilipLangiewicz/ActivityDetection/blob/main/documentation/prezentacja_wynik%C3%B3w.pdf).
